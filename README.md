In this homework, you will build your own Android application that interacts with the Google geocoding API and the Dark Sky API. Your app will display current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation) of a location (specified as a string containing an address) entered by the user, as well as showing that location on a map. 
 
Overall, in this assignment you will explore and learn how to:
Use a web service API within a mobile application
Create GET requests to interface with the API 
Use a JSON parser 
Obtain location coordinates using the Android SDK 
Build a user interface to support the requested app features

. This API can convert a string address into geographic coordinates. In order to have access to weather data, you should use the Dark Sky API, which is located at https://darksky.net/dev

. After you create a developer account for free, you will be able to query the API for weather information according to the documentation at https://darksky.net/dev/docs

. Feel free to use available Dark Sky API libraries if you would like, but they might be more trouble than they are worth given the scope of the project.
Consult the Java SDK documentation and other online resources to learn how to create GET requests, parse JSON data, obtain geographical coordinates using the Android SDK, etc. We have not covered these topics in class so this is an opportunity for you to “learn-how-to-learn”.
